# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn, which refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses as it helps them identify and retain customers at risk of leaving. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze customer data and predict churn probability.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
- Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn.
- Identify key factors contributing to customer churn.
- Provide actionable insights to reduce churn rate and improve customer retention strategies.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing historical customer data, including features such as customer demographics, transaction history, usage patterns, and churn status (whether the customer churned or not). The dataset is used for training and evaluating the churn prediction model.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features, correlations, and patterns related to churn.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features or create new features that may improve the predictive performance of the model.
4. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models using various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC.
6. **Model Selection and Tuning**: Select the best-performing model and fine-tune its hyperparameters to optimize predictive performance.
7. **Interpretation and Insights**: Interpret the model results to identify key factors influencing customer churn and provide actionable insights for business stakeholders.
